Q: Are we supposed to use GitHub Issues for our tracking tool? If that's the case, how do we export as a pdf to create tracking.pdf?

A:You can use any tool your group prefers. I would recommend GitHub as that is used by fast number of employers. 
You might have to take screenshots and or copy things out manually and clean it up a bit. 
If you include screenshots, you MUST write some additional explanation as to what the relevant things in the screenshots are. Just a screenshot is insufficient. The screenshots function as supporting evidence of the work you have done or the point you are trying to bring across in the documentation.
