# TODO: Everything
Sprint Completion: (Max 20 marks)
- With A Minimum Of 5 Stories
[x = Percentage of story points completed * 20]

From Piazza:
Q: Could you give a more in-depth explanation of what the expectations are for this PDF? Since this deliverable is worth a significant portion of the final grade (20 marks) there should be more to it than just listing at least 5 user stories & calculating our percentage of total points done in sprint 1?

I would assume we would also have to justify here why the listed user stories are completed, whether it be through screenshots, github recipts, etc., as well as maybe some reflection on how they went. But I feel like that would overlap with the other docs especially tracking.pdf

So is it really just enough to do what I quoted above? Given its worth so many marks?

A: I think you you pretty much have it figured out.
What were those stories, how many points were they worth, put some screenshots in from your bug tracking system that they are closed, maybe if possible put some screenshots in of the features existing.

I have seen people do well with half a page writing about the stories (keeping it brief and easy to see what they are --> easy to comprehend and mark), and 2 pages of (very very large screenshots). 

But I've also seen groups submit 15 pages for this, again detailing what the stories are, how they connect to the project as a whole, do they have dependencies that are also complete, do they unblock something, plus screenshots of the tracking system and maybe screenshots of the feature related to the user story if it makes sense. 

==> I'd say you are on the right track; sometimes it is "really just enough" (to quote you) ...  plus maybe some of the things I mentioned.
