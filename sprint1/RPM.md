# Release Planning Meeting
## Meeting on January 25th at 11:00 AM
Lasted 35 minutes.

**Goals:**
- Develop a production-ready Postgres database schema that securely stores user and provider data and can evolve through controlled migrations.
- Provide a fully initialized front-end application that allows developers to rapidly build and test user flows without backend dependencies.
- Deasign and create a clear and secure API layer that defines how the frontend and backend communicate for user and provider data.
- Implement a location-based provider search that combines verified internal providers with external Google Maps listings.

**Attendees:** Drew Nerbas, Parth Jain, Martin Stric, Saahil Pandit, and Jordan Jones
