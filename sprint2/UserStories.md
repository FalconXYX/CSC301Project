## Broken Down Into Tasks
Sprint is broken down into tasks and assigned to team members. Refer to `CSC301-PhysioFind-Project-Tracking.png` and `Defined_Acceptance_Criteria_Example.png`.
Each sprint is labelled as **X.Y.Z** where **X** is the sprint number, **Y** is the epic number and **Z** is the task number.
For example, `2.1.1` is the first task of the first epic of the second sprint.
