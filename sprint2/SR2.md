Good Practices:
- We had daily stand ups consistently and everyone participated
- Pull Requests were reviwed within 24 hours
- Breaked tasks into subtasks in github project tracking
- Split up worked and assigned tickets very early

Bad Practices:
- Sometimes .env with sensitive info was pushed
- Supa base was made on a temporary account so we had to migrate it to a permanent one
