# Market Analysis

## Customer Base & Demographic

PhysioFind targets patients in Ontario who want to find and book allied health services such as physiotherapy, chiropractic care, and registered massage therapy (RMT). Ontario has a population of 16 million people and 15–20% of adults seek physiotherapy or chiropractic services annually, and around. To remain conservative and realistic, we assume that 15% of Ontario residents use at least one allied health service per year. This results in approximately 2,250,000 potential annual users. Note sources are linked below.

Only a fraction would use a discovery platform online. We estimate that 40% prefer searching online for providers while the rest do it on referrals. Of that segment, we assume 20% would be open to trying a new platform like PhysioFind. This means we can reach 180,000 users in Year 1. As we are a new start up to remain conservative we assume only 5% of the users we reach become active users in Year 1, which results in approximately 9,000 active patient users after one year of operation.

This is for the customer side, on the provider side, As of 2024 Ontario has approximately 11,000 physiotherapists, 5,000 chiropractors, and 15,000 registered massage therapists, totaling around 34,000 allied health professionals. Many of these providers operate within shared clinics. Assuming 30% work in shared clinics, we estimate there are approximately 8,000–10,000 relevant clinics in Ontario would bennifit from our platform.

## Revenue Model

PhysioFind uses a simple B2B subscription model that charges clinics a fixed monthly fee, while patients can access the site for free. The benefits provided to clinics for their subscription include increased visibility, a profile that can be searched by others, and a ranking in local searches along with a link to integrate with their booking system. For these reasons we have priced our subscription at $49.99/month/clinic. Zocdoc ([zocdoc.com](https://www.zocdoc.com)), a competitor to PhysioFind, uses a "pay-per-new-booking" model in which patients search for and make appointments for free, but the provider is charged a one time fee for each patient booked. While Zocdoc's cost model for its service providers is variable, based upon the number of bookings made, and the service provider may also incur costs for placing their listing as a sponsor, PhysioFind will provide a stable monthly cost structure to clinics, including those that are smaller or mid-sized allied health service providers located in Ontario. Since PhysioFind focuses exclusively on physiotherapy and other related services and only conducts business in the province of Ontario, PhysioFind has the advantage of being a more localized and therefore a more financially stable option than Zocdoc's larger marketplace model.

If PhysioFind captures 5% of Ontario’s estimated 8,000–10,000 clinics in Year 1, that equals roughly 500 subscribing clinics. At $49.99 per month, this generates approximately $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue, or about $300,000 annually. These projections use conservative adoption assumptions and reflect a realistic market entry.
