## 2. Retrospective Analysis

### Good Practices
- We had daily stand ups consistently and everyone participated.
- Pull Requests were reviewed within 24 hours.
- Broke tasks into subtasks in github project tracking.
- Split up worked and assigned tickets very early.

### Bad Practices
- Sometimes `.env` with sensitive info was pushed.
- Supabase was made on a temporary account so we had to migrate it to a permanent one.
