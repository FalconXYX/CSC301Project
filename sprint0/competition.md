## Competitive Analysis

- **Lumino Health:** Lumino Health is a large provider directory made by Sun Life Financial. It helps millions of Canadians find paramedical services and check insurance costs. However, it functions largely as a search tool rather than a matching service. It lists providers but doesn't actively help the user find the option that works best for them. It is also naturally optimized for Sun Life members, which can make it less seamless for those with different or no insurance. PhysioFind differentiates by being an insurance-agnostic platform that actively matches users to the right specialist based on the patient, rather than just providing a list of names.

- **Google Maps:** Google Maps is the default tool for finding local businesses, offering accurate locations and hours. However, it is a general directory that only confirms a clinic exists. It doesn't offer medical context or personalized guidance. PhysioFind differentiates by filtering results based on specifc user needs, helping users find a clinic capable of treating their specific condition in a context that works for them rather than just showing the closest or highest stared option.

* **Opencare:** Opencare is a matching platform that connects patients with providers, but they are almost entirely a dental marketplace. They have proven that the "vetted marketplace" model works in Canada, but they simply do not service the rehabilitation market. PhysioFind differentiates by covering the specific services Opencare ignores: physiotherapy, chiropractic, and massage therapy.

* **Zocdoc:** Zocdoc is a US-based online marketplace for finding doctors and booking appointments. They have established a successful model for connecting patients with providers and managing the booking process. However, they are a US company built for the American private healthcare system, which is fundamentally incompatible with Canada's and specfically Ontario's. Their system cannot accommodate the specific requirements of OHIP, which allows PhysioFind to operate in the niche that the local market provides.
