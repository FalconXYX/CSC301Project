## Team organization divided clearly (Roles):
**Scrum Master**  
- Not a traditional lead or management role  
- Improves the use of Scrum through coaching, facilitation and rapid elimination of any distractions to the team  
- Ensure principles behind scrum remain intact even as the company’s own implementation evolves
- Sometimes scrum may be difficult to follow - the team may want to cut corners to 
deliver a sprint, the scrum master needs to remind them about what they must do  
- Nurture sense of ownership

**Product Owner**  
- Managing ROI (Return On Investment)  
- Establishes a shared vision for the product among the customers / developers  
- Knowing what to build and in what order  
- Owns the product backlog  
- Creating release plans and establishing delivery dates  
- Supporting spring planning and reviews  
- Representing the customers  

**Developer and domain experts**  
- Members of the team are primarily developers and testers, however in many projects, specialists from other disciplines may also join the team.

### Personal input on delegation:  
As our group is of 5 people, there will be 3 developers who are not the scrum master or product owner. These developers will need to be reexplained the product vision as it changes over time (during scrum meets) so that they can be in touch with the user stories and desired user experience. As this project starts being developed the product owner and scrum master have the important role of making the developers implement user stories as they originally envisioned it, while simultaneously taking in everyones oppinions of the project as it evolves.  
Right now from what management and work/input has been seen from the group thus far, I would delegate Drew as the scrum master and Paarth as the Product Owner.  
My reasoning for this designation is that Paarth was the one with the original idea, and has been very stringent on what is neccessary in the product. Drew got straight to it, and created a mock up right after our first scrum meeting of some of the user experiences. This delegation will have to be further discussed.

## Decision making:
- Heavily rely on user stories from the product backlog for goal setting.

- The team will use a points grading scheme for the level of difficulty of implementing new user stories. During the scrum meetings when a new user story is added to the product backlog, the team will collectively grade the story with a certain number of points (relative to the other stories) depending on how hard the team conceives this user story to be. This is so that the user stories can be broken down into smaller implementable tasks that can be split among the team if that user story is too much for only one person to complete.

- The **sprint length** will not vary in time as they are due at certain dates. Though the team can, and should, plan to have intermediate made-up sprint deadlines that will help us desolve any larger tasks into smaller ones. This should be decided by the scrum master.

### Project Due dates
    Sprint 0: Monday January 21th before 11:55pm (part of deliverable 1)  
    Sprint 1: Monday February 2nd before 11:55pm (part of deliverable 1)  
    Sprint 2: Monday February 23rd before 11:55pm (deliverable 2)  
    Sprint 3: March  March 22rd before 11:55pm (deliverable 3)  
    Final deliverable: Friday March 27th, 11:55pm (final deliverable 4)  


## Prioritizing user stories:
- Use **critical path method**
- Use **PERT** method (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) 
- Use a **Gantt** chart  
This will help us figure out which user stories are the most complex and unique/situational and helps with the time planning.

## Meetings
Via discord app.

## Next phase
When a user story is complete in the product backlog the team will all review it before pushing it to the main branch. There may be days where many user stories will be complete from different developers, the team will still need to review it before pushing it to the main branch.
